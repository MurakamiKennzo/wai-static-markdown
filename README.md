# wai-static-markdown

Haskell Markdown Server.

## Usage

### shell

```shell
$ ./shell/markdown-server
```

For Mac or other unix like system, I build an eexecutable file and you can use it whereever you want. Just add a static folder as the same path as the executable file and run it as a command shell.

Note: not run it as a root or user directory. If so, you should put the static folder at the root or user home directory. See shell.

### stack

```shell
$ stack setup
$ stack run
```

If you are good at haskell and stack, you will probably know what you should to do. Also, you can do whatever you wanna.

If not, I suggest you use the usage 1 and that is ok on any unix system. If you're a windows user, you know what you should do, right?
